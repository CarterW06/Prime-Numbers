#Prime-Numbers

Prime numbers is a project designated to help you find out information about *whatever* integer you want!

It accomplishes the following:

* Telling you if a number is prime or composite
* Giving you a list of primes within a certain range
* Giving you a specific prime (ex. input: 3, output: 5, since 5 is the 3rd prime)
* Giving you a prime factorization of a large number

Here are some examples:

Type of Algorithm|Prime or Composite|List of Primes|Specific Prime|Prime Factorization
---|---|---|---|---
Input|35|5, 10|4|75
Output|Composite|5, 7|7|3, 5, 5
